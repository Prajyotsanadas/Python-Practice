# # #Code challenge 1: 
# #There are 2 variables : a and b, Write a program that switches the value stored in the variables a and b.
# a = input()
# b = input()

# c = a # Creating a third variable will help switch the input
# a = b
# b = c 

# print("a: " + a)
# print("b: " + b)


# # questions
# #1. Create a greeting for your program
# #2. Ask the user the city that they grew up in
# #3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.

# name = input("Please enter your name: ")
# print("Welcome", name)

# #2.
# city = input("Which city did you grew up in ?: ")
# print(city)

# #3.
# pet = input("Please enter the name of your favourite pet: ")
# print(pet)

# #4.
# bandname = city + pet
# print("Your band name is: " + bandname)
# print("Your band name is: " +  " " + city + " " + pet)


# ######Code challenge 2 ######
# ## Write a program that adds the digit in 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35 then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
# ##Solution:
# two_digit_number = input("Enter a 2 digit number: ")

# first_digit_number = int(two_digit_number[0])
# second_digit_number = int(two_digit_number[1])

# #Add the two integer together
# two_digit_number = first_digit_number + second_digit_number

# print(two_digit_number )
print
